    "## IBM Data Science Coursera Capstone Project Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Mark Hanson\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook will be used for the final capstone project in the Coursera IBM Data Science Professional class.  In brief the requirements are to leverage Foursquare location data to explore or compare any choosen neighborhoods or cities or to come up with a problem that can be soloved with data obtained with the Foursquare API. Unfortunately, Foursquare timeseries data is only available to verified managers of Foursquare venues which makes answering some more interesting questions more difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Description of my capstone project\n",
    "For my capstone project I have choosen to cluster the cities in the Minneapolis / Saint Paul 7 county metropolitan area similar to what was done in the labs.  However, in addition to using Foursquare data, I downloaded real estate value data from Zillow and plan to use this to add more detail for the clustering algorithm.  As I get into the analysis I may change or expand the scope or objective of the project by identifying a specific question to answer or adding some more analysis.\n",

    "  Plot a choropleth style map of clusters to better visualize the entire zipcode vs just the bubble marker - When plotting geoJSON subset found counties scattered all over state. Also cluster map seems to leave off many metro area cities / zipcodes - cluster fix started - Hennepin county was misspelled.\n",
